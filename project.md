# This Dot Take-Home Exercise

We are looking to learn more about you as a developer. Feel free to "over-engineer" your solution or add additional features or playful flourishes. Ultimately, please build something that you feel proud to share with us.

Please use technologies you are most familiar with. This is to test technical acumen, and you won't be able to do so with a new tech.

Show us how you prioritize and think about products. We'll learn as much about you from what you have chosen not to include as we do from the items you include!

Feel free to utilize third-party libraries or additional code you did not write to help you complete the exercise. However, please clarify which code you wrote versus what you borrowed from other sources. Be sure there's enough of your work to give us an accurate impression of your capabilities.

The exercise requests you create a movie search app utilizing our public movie API. Please share a working deployed version of the exercise and a GitHub repository with the code.

## Setup

- Please use a modern JavaScript framework or library - Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, LitElement, etc.
- Use the latest version of the framework or library.
- You may use any build system you wish, including any CLI.
- You may use any additional third-party libraries you see fit.

## Rules

- The app should NOT require users of the application to provide any permissions.
- Do not include "This Dot" anywhere in the repository.
- You may use starter kits or boilerplate apps. However, please do not fork or leverage other existing projects.
  - If the project is copied, forked, or forged in any way, our review team considers it an automatic fail.
  - Consider using `npx create` scripts
  - We maintain https://starter.dev/, which can be used to scaffold your submission.
- In your project's README, please include details about the following:
  - Highlight something in your project that you thought was especially interesting or significant to your overall implementation.
  - Tell us what you are most pleased or proud of with your implementation.
  - Given more time, what next feature or improvement would you like to add to your project?

## Minimum Requirements

As a user,

- I can search for movies and see a paginated list of results
- I can filter search results by genre
- I can navigate through the next and previous pages of the paginated results
- I see the total count of search results
- I see notable information for each search result, such as the summary, poster, duration, rating, etc.

We are not expecting a professional design, so focus on the functionality and code.

## API Information

The app should utilize the REST or GraphQL API provided by our Movies API. The documentation for utilizing this API can be found at https://github.com/thisdot/movies-api.

The base URL for tZhe API is https://0kadddxyh3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
